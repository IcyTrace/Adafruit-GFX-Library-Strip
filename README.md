# [Adafruit GFX Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) Striped

This is a strip down version of the orignial `Adafruit GFX Library`

The original library ties to Arduino/AVR/etc., and forced to use with `Adafruit BusIO`, which is not ideal when people just want a GFX library that draws on to a frame buffer.
